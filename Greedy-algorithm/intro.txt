Acitivity Selection Problem:

- Given a 2-d array with each item representing start and finish time of an acitivity 
- Find the maximum number of acitivity and their index that can be done so that they do not coincide 
- Seems like an interval problem 

Solution 

- Sort the acitivities on the basis of finish time in ascending order 
- If finish time is the same pick any one, lets pick the one will smaller finish time - doesn't matter 
- First interval will always be in the result 
- Start looping from the second one and if its start time does not overlap with the previous one push it into result
- Return the result or count whatever needed 

sort 
result.push_back(intervals[0]);

for(int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {

	if(intervals[i][0] >= result.back()[1]) result.push_back(intervals[i]);
}

return result;
