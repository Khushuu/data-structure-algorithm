// given a graph
// return true or false if there exists a cycle in the graph

// parent --> node that calls the dfs function
// back edge --> edge that connects a node to its ancestor which is not its direct parent

// if u found a node that is already visited 
// and this node was visited from some other path
// i.e if u reach current node via parent always like a tree --> it won't have cycle
// as there will only be one path to reach a node via its parent
// but if u find a node that is already visited and 
// there is an edge between this visited node which is not the parent of current node that means 
// more than 1 path exists and there is a cycle in the graph 


// Undirected Graph 
// A cycle is detected if we visit a previously visited node that is not the parent of the current node.

// Cycle Detection in an Undirected Graph
// Approach: Using DFS
// Maintain a visited array.
// Keep track of the parent node to avoid counting the immediate previous node as a cycle.
// If we encounter a visited node that is not the parent, a cycle is detected.

// NOTE:
// Why Do We Need the Parent in Cycle Detection for an Undirected Graph?
// When we traverse an undirected graph using DFS, we move from a node to its neighbor.
// Since the graph is undirected, every edge is bi-directional.
// If we only check for visited[node], we might incorrectly detect a cycle.

// ðŸ”¹ Why Does This Happen?

// Consider a simple graph:
//    1 -- 2

// DFS starts at node 1 and visits node 2.
// Now, node 2 sees that node 1 is already visited.
// If we donâ€™t track the parent, we might incorrectly detect a cycle.
// âœ… Correct Condition: A cycle exists only if a visited node is not the parent of the current node.


// Undirected Graph â†’ Use DFS with parent tracking.
// Directed Graph (DFS) â†’ Use recursion stack tracking.
// Directed Graph (BFS - Kahnâ€™s Algorithm) â†’ Use Topological Sorting.
// Time Complexity â†’ O(N + E) in all cases.

// Time Complexity: O(N + E) â†’ DFS traverses each node and edge once.
// Space Complexity: O(N + E) â†’ Adjacency list storage + recursion stack.
