// 802. Find Eventual Safe States

// You are given a directed graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1. 
// A node is eventually safe if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node
// A terminal node is a node that has no outgoing edges.
// Return an ascending sorted list of all eventual safe nodes.

// Approach
// all nodes that are part of a cycle will never be safe nodes 
// y? -- because there path will never terminate
// so the nodes which are not part of any cycle are safe nodes

// also all the nodes that are present in the stack at the time of finding cycle will be unsafe
// even if they are not part of the cycle
// y --> because there was a path that lead them to enter into a cycle - a never ending path
// and the questions ask that all path should lead to a safe node --> terminal node 

// since we return as soon as we find a cycle in a directed graph
// we do not backtrack and set inStack = false is not set
// this means all the nodes for which inStack = true are nodes present in cycle = unsafe nodes
// so at the end of traversing all the connected components --> the nodes which have inStack = false --> safe nodes
// as we use !visited to run dfs again -- nodes with inStack = true will already be visited
//  and won't be picked again for running dfs

// NOTE:
// if we start from a node that is in the cyle -- all nodes will be traversed and inStack = true for those
// now when we pick another node that leads to cycle
// isVisited will be true for cycle node and inStack will also be true
// this means the node that connects to a cycle will also have inStack = true and will return true for hasCycle call

// DFS
// T.C = O(n + e)
// S.C = O(n)

// BFS
// Kahn's algorithm - topological sorting
// terminal nodes have outdegree == 0 --> all edges directed towards them --> u

// so all nodes which have inDegree = 0 and can be picked for traversal will be safe nodes 

// Concept
// Reverse the graph (reverseGraph), making terminal nodes sources.
// Use Kahnâ€™s Algorithm (BFS):
// Start with terminal nodes (no outgoing edges).
// Process their incoming edges.
// If a node has no outgoing edges left, it's safe.
// The final safe nodes are the ones we processed.
