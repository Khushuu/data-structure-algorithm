Shortest path

-- Single source shortest path 
-- All source shortest path

-- Single source shortest path 
	-- unweighted --> bfs -- T.C = O(v + e)
	-- weighted --> +ve weights ==> dijkstra's algorithm -- T.C = O(e * log v)
	-- weighted --> -ve weights ==> bellman ford algorithm -- T.C = O(v * e)

-- All source shortest path
	-- weighted --> -ve weights ==> floyd warshall algorithm -- T.C = O(v^3)


-- BFS doesn't work for weighted graph as it considers all edges as same
-- without any consideration to the weight attached to the edge
