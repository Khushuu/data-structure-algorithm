// To find bridges in a graph (also known as cut-edges)
// we use a DFS-based algorithm known as Tarjanâ€™s Algorithm for bridges.

// back-edge: edge connecting a node to its ancestor which is not its direct parent
// presence of back-edge means there is cycle in the graph

// back-edge can never be a bridge
// bridge is an edge whose removal makes the graph disconnected
// even if u remove the back-edge the graph will still be connected by forward edge
// hence back-edge can never be a bridge 

// only a forward edge can be a bridge

// concept
// In an undirected graph, an edge is a bridge if removing it increases the number of connected components.
// In Time: The time when a node is first visited.
// Low Time: The earliest visited vertex (the lowest in time) reachable from the subtree rooted with that node.

// all nodes in a cycle will finally have the same low time 

// An edge (u, v) is a bridge if:
// low[v] > in[u]
// i.e low[child] > in[node]

// 1192. Critical Connections in a Network
// optimization
// u can use in time to identify if a node is visited or not
// intialize it with -1 and if a node is not visited its value will be -1
// remove using visited array then

// code
