Connected and Strongly Connected Components in a Graph

Connected Components: Undirected Graph
Strongly Connected Components: Directed Graph
DFS/BFS are efficient for O(N + E) solution.

1️⃣ Connected Components (Undirected Graph)

A connected component is a maximal set of vertices where there is a path between any two vertices.

If a node is reachable from another node, they belong to the same connected component.
Any node not reachable from a component forms a separate component.

✅ Example:
Graph with 6 nodes (0 to 5)

  0 -- 1    3 -- 4
  |           |
  2          5


👉 This graph has two connected components:

{0, 1, 2}
{3, 4, 5}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2️⃣ Strongly Connected Components (Directed Graph)

A Strongly Connected Component (SCC) in a directed graph is a maximal subset of nodes where every node can reach every other node in the component.

✅ Example:

css
Copy
Edit
  A → B
  ↑   ↓
  D ← C
👉 {A, B, C, D} forms one SCC, since every node can reach every other.
