Graphs are fundamental data structures in computer science, used to represent networks, relationships, and connections. 
They consist of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections between nodes). There are several types of graphs, classified based on their properties.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Edge Direction

1.1 Undirected Graph
Edges have no direction (i.e., if an edge exists between A and B, you can travel both ways).

Example:

  A -- B
  |    |
  C -- D

Representation: Adjacency List or Adjacency Matrix.
Applications: Social Networks, Road Networks.


1.2 Directed Graph (Digraph)
Edges have a direction (i.e., if an edge exists from A to B, you can only go from A ‚Üí B, not B ‚Üí A).

Example:

  A ‚Üí B
  ‚Üë    ‚Üì
  C ‚Üê D

Representation: Adjacency List with Direction.
Applications: Web Crawling, Task Scheduling.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Edge Weight

2.1 Unweighted Graph
All edges have equal weight (or no weights at all).

Example:

  A -- B
  |    |
  C -- D

Applications: Social Networks, Friend Recommendations.

2.2 Weighted Graph
Edges have weights (costs) associated with them.

Example:

  A --(4)-- B
  |         |
 (2)       (7)
  |         |
  C --(3)-- D

Applications: Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Cycles

3.1 Acyclic Graph
No cycles (closed loops) exist.

Example:

  A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C
  ‚Üì
  D

Applications: Dependency Graphs, Scheduling.

3.2 Cyclic Graph
Contains at least one cycle.

Example:

  A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C
  ‚Üë       ‚Üì
  E ‚Üê D

Applications: Deadlock Detection, Network Routing.


4Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Connectivity

4.1 Connected Graph
There is a path between every pair of nodes.

Example:

  A -- B
  |    |
  C -- D
Applications: Communication Networks.

4.2 Disconnected Graph
Not all nodes are reachable from each other.

Example:

  A -- B    C -- D

Applications: Isolated Networks, Clustering.


5Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Bipartiteness

5.1 Bipartite Graph
Nodes can be divided into two sets such that no two nodes in the same set are adjacent.

Example:

  Set1: A, C
  Set2: B, D
    A -- B
    |    |
    C -- D

Applications: Matching Problems, Graph Coloring.

5.2 Non-Bipartite Graph
Cannot be divided into two sets as described above.

Example:

  A -- B -- C
   \      /
     D
Applications: Complex Network Structures.


6Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Special Properties

6.1 Complete Graph (Kn)
Every pair of nodes is directly connected by an edge.

Example (K4):

    A -- B
   / \  / \
  C -- D
Applications: Network Design, Clique Detection.

6.2 Tree (Acyclic Connected Graph)
A special type of graph with N-1 edges and no cycles.

Example:

      A
     / \
    B   C
   / \
  D   E

Applications: File System Hierarchies, Decision Trees.

6.3 Forest (Collection of Trees)
A set of multiple trees (disconnected acyclic graphs).

Example:

    A       D
   / \     /
  B   C   E

Applications: MST Algorithms (Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm).

6.4 Planar Graph
Can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing.

Example:

    A -- B
   /      \
  C ------ D

Applications: Geographic Mapping, Circuit Design.

6.5 Eulerian Graph
A graph where you can traverse each edge exactly once and return to the starting node.

Eulerian Circuit: Exists if all vertices have even degrees.
Eulerian Path: Exists if exactly two vertices have odd degrees.
Applications: Chinese Postman Problem, Route Optimization.

6.6 Hamiltonian Graph
A graph where you can visit each vertex exactly once in a cycle.
Applications: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
