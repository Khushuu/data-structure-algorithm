-- since in recursion we always have option of choices and decisions
-- in tree also we have some choices and on the basis of that we make decisions 

-- suppose in problem: diameter of a tree 
-- any root has two choices 
-- either it becomes the subtree that contributes to the diameter 
-- or it becomes a left or right arm of any other node 
-- we deduce the max result by considering if the node became the main diameter 
-- and we return the value when it doesn't 

-- temp --> the answer that we will return to main call 
-- ans --> the answer that will include the current node as the decisive one 
-- result --> deduce the result using ans 
-- return temp to the main call
